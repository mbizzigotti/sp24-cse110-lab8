Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that both aim to enhance the resilience and performance of web applications by addressing different levels of functionality. Graceful degradation involves starting with the most advanced technologies and ensuring that the application still functions at a basic level if some features are not supported. Service workers contribute to this by acting as a middle layer that handles tasks such as caching and network requests independently of the main application. This allows the web app to function smoothly even under suboptimal conditions, such as limited connectivity or lower-end devices. By offloading these tasks to service workers, the application can maintain core functionalities and performance, embodying the principles of graceful degradation by ensuring a usable experience across various environments.
